1. **Create a [Customer](/api-documentation/customers/create)**

<Tip>
  Store the `id` of the `Customer` object. You will need it to create the
  `Payout Target`.
</Tip>

2. **Create a [Payout Target](/api-documentation/payoutTargets/create)**

<Tip>
  Store the `id` of the `Payout Target` object. You will need it to create the
  `Payout Request`.
</Tip>

3. **Redirect the customer**

The `Payout Target` has an attribute `authUrl`. The customer will needs to verify the `Payout Target` before it can be used. When the customer completes the auth flow, Palomma will redirect the user back to the `redirectUrl` you provided when creating the `Payout Target`.

4. **Wait for webhook notification**

Palomma will send a webhook event confirming when the `Payout Target` changes `status`. If the `status` is `active`, you can create a `Payout Request`.

5. **Create a [Payout Request](/api-documentation/payoutRequests/create)**

<Tip>
  You only need to follow steps 1-4 once. If you have a `Payout Target` that is
  `active`, you can go straight to this step.
</Tip>

6. **Wait for webhook notification**

Palomma will send a webhook event notifying you when the `Payout Request` changes `status`.
