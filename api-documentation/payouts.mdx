1. **Create a [Customer](/api-documentation/customers/create)**

2. **Create a [Payout Target](/api-documentation/payoutTargets/create)**

3. **Redirect the customer**

The `Payout Target` has an attribute `authUrl`. The customer must verify the `Payout Target` before it can be used. When the customer completes the auth flow, Palomma will redirect the user back to the `redirectUrl` you provided when creating the `Payout Target`.

4. **Wait for webhook notification**

Palomma will send a webhook event confirming when the `Payout Target` is active.

5. **Create a [Payout Request](/api-documentation/payoutRequests/create)**

<Tip>
  You only need steps 1-4 for the first payout. Future payouts can use the same
  `Payout Source`.
</Tip>

6. **Wait for webhook notification**

Palomma will send a webhook event notifying you when the `Payout Request` changes `status`.
