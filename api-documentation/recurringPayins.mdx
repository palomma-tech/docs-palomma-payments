title: Recurring Payins
---

1. **Create a [Customer](/api-documentation/customers/create)**

2. **Create a [Payin Source](/api-documentation/payinSources/create)**

3. **Redirect the customer**

The `Payin Source` has an attribute `authUrl`. The customer will authenticate and then authorize you to debit from their account. When the customer completes the auth flow, Palomma will redirect the user back to the `redirectUrl` you provided when creating the `Payin Source`.

4. **Wait for webhook notification**

Palomma will send a webhook event confirming when the `Payin Source` is active.

5. **Create a [Payin Request](/api-documentation/payinRequests/create)**

<Tip>
  You only need steps 1-4 for the first payin. Future payins can use the same
  `Payin Source`.
</Tip>

6. **Wait for webhook notification**

Palomma will send a webhook event notifying you when the `Payin Request` changes `status`.
