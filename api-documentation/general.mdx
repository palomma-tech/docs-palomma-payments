## Environments

Test using the sandbox environment, which doesnâ€™t touch real money. Contact the Palommma team when you are ready for production release.

Production

```jsx
https://prod.api.palomma.com/v0
```

Sandbox

```jsx
https://sandbox.api.palomma.com/v0
```

## Authentication

You should have received an API key from the onboarding process. Every request to the Palomma API should include an Authentication header:

```jsx
Authentication: `Bearer ${apiKey}`;
```
