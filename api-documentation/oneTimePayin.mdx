title: One-Time Payin
---

1. **Create a [Customer](/api-documentation/customers/create)**

2. **Create a [Payin Link](/api-documentation/payinLinks/create)**

3. **Redirect the customer**

The `Payin Link` has an attribute `paymentUrl`. This is the url where the user will fill in their payment information and approve the payment. When the customer completes the payment flow, Palomma will redirect the user back to the `redirectUrl` you provided when creating the `Payin Link`.

4. **Wait for webhook notification**

Palomma will send a webhook event notifying you when the `Payin Link` changes `status`.
